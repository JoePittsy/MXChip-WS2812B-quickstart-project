## Setup
First make sure that you have set up your MXChip and VSCode environment, if you have not then follow [this guide from Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/get-started/)

Once that is done open this project, change the variables for LED amount and PIN number and upload the code to the device. Make sure that you have your MXChip plugged in and the correct port selected in VSCode else the upload process will fail
